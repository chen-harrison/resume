\begin{personalstatement}
    Robotics software engineer with experience in developing and integrating navigation, perception, and mapping algorithms for mobile robotics systems. Proficient in programming with C++ and Python, as well as robotics-specific libraries such as ROS and Eigen. I am a self-driven learner who enjoys tackling complex challenges, especially in a collaborative manner. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to build technologies that make a positive impact.

\section{Experience}

\entry{Autonomy Engineer}{PDW}{New Rochelle, NY}{Mar 2022 – Jan 2025}
\begin{details}
    \item Augmented quadcopter’s autonomy stack with trajectory generation capable of obstacle avoidance and breadth-first search for safe start and goal positions, increasing safety and reliability while flying
    \item Utilized runtime polymorphism to modularize navigation pipeline, improving code abstraction and allowing for multiple flight modes with unique implementations
    \item Evaluated stereo depth DNNs on Nvidia Jetson; calibrated Arducam sensors for disparity to depth conversion, wrote nodes to run TensorRT and ONNX models, and explored quantization options using MATLAB and Nvidia TAO
    \item Integrated multi-sensor OctoMap and Voxblox 3D mapping algorithms into a C++ ROS package, enabling quadcopter to map occupancy by combining input from forward- and downward-facing RealSense cameras
\end{details}

\entry{Robotics Engineer}{Jugaad Labs}{Philadelphia, PA}{Mar 2021 – Mar 2022}
\begin{details}
    \item Developed an automotive situational awareness system for semi-trucks in Python and ROS, using center point-based object detection and Kalman filter tracking to identify and monitor nearby vehicles
    \item Built application with Nvidia Isaac SDK to perform object detection in Isaac Sim warehouse environment, serving as a theoretical sensing foundation for autonomous logistics
\end{details}

\entry{Applied Product Development Intern}{FANUC America}{Rochester Hills, MI}{Jun 2020 – Aug 2020}
\begin{details}
    \item Strengthened functionality for ArcTool recovery mechanism using proprietary programming language Karel, enabling welding robots to recalibrate in any reachable end effector pose
\end{details}

\entry{Student / Team Member}{Robotic Systems Laboratory Course (ROB 550)}{Ann Arbor, MI}{Jan 2020 – May 2020}
\begin{details}
    \item Implemented a simulated SLAM robot in C++ with 2D occupancy grid mapping, odometry motion model, beam measurement model, Monte Carlo localization, and A* path planning
    \item Collaborated with teammates on the development of an inverted pendulum robot using C and RCL, including PID control for balancing, manual steering via joystick, and autonomous movement along series of waypoints
\end{details}
